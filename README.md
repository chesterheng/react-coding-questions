# React Coding Questions

## Contact Form

- The form should contain the following elements:
  - Name field
  - Email field
  - Message field. Since the message can be long, using a <textarea> will be more suitable.
  - Submit button
    - Contains the text "Send".
    - Clicking on the submit button submits the form.
- The form and submission should be implemented mostly in HTML.
- There is no need to do any client-side validation on the fields. Validation will be done on the server side.

## Counter

- Make the text within the button display the number of times the button has been clicked.
